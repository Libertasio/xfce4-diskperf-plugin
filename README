Disk performance XFce4 panel plugin (DiskPerf)
==============================================


1 -	Description
	-----------
The DiskPerf plugin displays disk/partition performance based on the rsect/wsect data provided by recent Linux kernels (at least 2.4.20 - I think - compiled with CONFIG_BLK_STATS turned on, or possibly older kernel patched with "Disk extended statistics" in /proc/partitions).

To know if your system provides such statistics:
        - less /proc/partitions
        - check that there are rsect/wsect data

The code of this plugin has been written starting from the Xfce4 sample-plugin example (www.xfce.org), then looking at both systemload (Riccardo Persichetti - ricpersi@libero.it) and netload (Bernhard Walle - bernhard.walle@gmx.de) XFce4 goodies.

DiskPerf has only been tested on Mandrake 9.1 (kernel 2.4.21)


2 -	Installation
	------------
Do the usual stuff:
	- gunzip
        - tar xf
        - configure --prefix=<XFce4InstallationDir>	(e.g. /usr)
        - make
        - make install  (as root)
	
You should then end up with:
        libdiskperf.a   libdiskperf.la  libdiskperf.so
installed in <XFce4InstallationDir>/lib/xfce4/panel-plugins/


3 -	Port
	----
Currently, DiskPerf runs only on recent Linux kernels (my single home computer is equipped with Mandrake Linux 9.1).
If one would like to port this plugin onto another OS, please feel free to send me your patch.
Furthermore, if you wish to take over the development of DiskPerf, just let me know. I would probably be able to provide you with useful information on how to get disk statistics on some commercial Unices (e.g. SunOS/Solaris).


4 -	Bugs
	----
If you find a bug (on Linux), please send me the result of "uname -a" as well as 2 snapshots of your /proc/partitions taken at 10-second interval.


Enjoy!
